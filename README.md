# No Rounded Switcher

This is my first Android RRO layer, which customizes just one value.

It modifies 'the radius of the rounded corners on a task view' back to the original value. Only for ROMs which have changed this to be more rounded than usual.

1. From Android Studio, build the project.
2. Copy the output apk file `systemui_overlay.apk` to `/system/vendor/overlay/` (OR, install with Layers Manager)
